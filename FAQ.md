<h4> 1. How can I get involved? </h4>

Many ways! Head on over to the [Contribute Page](https://eivimeycook.github.io/MeRIT/Contribute.html) for more information.

<br>

<h4> 2. How does the MeRIT system work? </h4>

Simple. Rather than using the traditional style of method writing, each part of the research, from running models to collecting data, is accompanied by an initial letting the reader know who performed such an action. Thus increasing transparency, granularity, accountability and allowing appropriate credit to be given.

<h4>  3. What do you do when two (or more) people have the same initials? </h4>

In this case you can spell out family names (e.g. PP = Patrice Pottier and Pietro Pollo would become PPottier and PPollo).

<br>

<h4>  4. What do you do when you have many authors on one paper? </h4>

In this circumstance you could create a group system where multiple authors are listed in the various large groups in which they particpated. 

For instance, “L.R, H.W, P.P, K.M, C.W, L.M did this and that. S.N, P.P, K.M, C.W, L.M did this and that” becomes “Group 1 did this and that. Group 2 did this and that”. A list of authors included in the various groups might be included in the supplemental materials.

<h4>  5. How will this system work when there are restrictive word counts? </h4>

It is our belief that this will not substantially alter the length of methods sections and in some journals, there is no limit on the word count for the methods section. However, if this is indeed an issue, then supplementary methods could be used to provide added granularity as to precise roles using the MeRIT system. 

<br>

<h4>  6. What do you do if you've supervised an action? </h4>

As mentioned in the accompanying paper, for supervisory or advisory roles you can still use the MeRIT system, e.g., “REO conducted the statistical analysis with the support of JLP”.
